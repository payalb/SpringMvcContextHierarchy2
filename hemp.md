WebApplicationContext
WebApplicationContext in Spring is web aware ApplicationContext i.e it has Servlet Context information. In single web application there can be multiple WebApplicationContext. That means each DispatcherServlet associated with single WebApplicationContext. The WebApplicationContext configuration file *-servlet.xml is specific to the DispatcherServlet and a web application can have more than one DispatcherServlet configured to handle the requests and each DispatcherServlet would have a separate *-servlet.xml file to configure. But, applicationContext.xml will be common for all the servlet configuration files. By default DispatcherServlet loads file name servletName-servlet.xml from your webapps WEB-INF folder. If you want to change the name of that file name or change the location, add init-param with contextConfigLocation as param name.

ContextLoaderListener
This listener is responsible to load the context configuration files. It performs the actual initialization work for the root application context. It reads a “contextConfigLocation” context-param and passes its value to the context instance. We can pass multiple files in the context configuration by commas or space separation. e.g. “WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml, WEB-INF/applicationContext-security.xml”.
